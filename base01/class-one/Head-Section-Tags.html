        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure webpages. <br> It provides the basic framework for web content by using a system of elements, or "tags," that define the structure of text, images, links, tables, and other elements on a webpage. HTML works alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it a fundamental part of web development. With the introduction of HTML5, modern web pages now support multimedia elements, improved semantics, and better accessibility. As a result, HTML remains the backbone of the internet, enabling developers to build <strong><em>responsive</em></strong> and user-friendly <b>websites.</b></p>
